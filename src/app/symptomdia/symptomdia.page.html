        <p>Diabetes symptoms vary depending on how much your blood sugar is elevated. Some people, especially those with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, may sometimes not experience symptoms. In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe.</p><br>
        <p>Some of the signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Increased thirst</li>
  <li>Frequent urination</li>
  <li>Extreme hunger</li>
  <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
  <li>Presence of ketones in the urine (ketones are a byproduct of the breakdown of muscle and fat that happens when there's not enough available insulin)</li>
  <li>Fatigue</li>
  <li>Irritability</li>
  <li>Blurred vision</li>
  <li>Slow-healing sores</li>
  <li>Frequent infections, such as gums or skin infections and vaginal infections</li>
</ul>
<p>Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, though it often appears during childhood or adolescence. Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age, though it's more common in people older than 40.</p>

          <li>You suspect you or your child may have diabetes</li>

        <p>If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your doctor. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You've already been diagnosed with diabetes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After you receive your diagnosis, you'll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar levels stabilize.</p>
